        </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch
              of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
              tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over
              medium heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and
              bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
              coat the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set
              at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle
              your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook,
              carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
              for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if
              needed.
